<h3> Not a resolution, but a contemplation. </h3>

<br/>
Last year I took a slightly different approach to growing myself in my career. I stepped away from events and focused instead of growing in my own day-to-day work. This was not an easy choice and meant walking away from the work to stay a Microsoft MVP, talking at events, and even aligned with finally saying goodbye to DDD East Midlands Conference. Those who know me personally, know how hard this was personally. I invest my whole self into my community endeavors, and it has been a source of satisfaction and of my own internalised sense of value. 

I did this for a few reasons. Firstly, I was tired. I'm an introverted soul at heart and to put all my energy into doing my best at my day job for my team, then doing more outside of work - I was focusing all my energy on other people and not spending any of it on me. I was heading fast to full burn out (which is always a balance). Another reason was at the end of 2024 my position changed at work to being a Head Of, and that meant my responsibilities and nature of my work changed. I was responsible for the technical strategy of a whole platform, for teams and individuals and their growth, for quality of design and software, and I was now having meetings with senior leadership and clients. I'm proud of the work I do and the teams I work with and I wanted to perform at my best. To do so, while adapting to this change I wanted to focus my energies on doing the best I could in this role and growing into it.

Looking back, I have no regrets about this decision. Part of the reason is, though I have always enjoyed work and found it interesting, in all my previous roles there was always something missing. I filled that gap with community work, helping me achieve the balance I needed. Turns out, a leadership role (like being the Head of Architecture) is the sort of role that hits every note for me. I'm challenged by it and I am genuinely passionate about driving decisions that help the long term strategy of a business but also the people working with and around me. I've really enjoyed my job, and because of that I genuinely believe I grew to be really pretty good at it. I wouldn't have been able to settle into it as well if I hadn't focused all my attention into doing so.

Once I settled into the rhythm at work, I started to spend some of my "work energy" on learning again. I did my TOGAF exams which is something I've wanted to do for a while but never found the time for previously. I sorted out learning and progression plans for others. I started mentoring and coaching again. I grew in different and unexpected ways.

## Then December came.

In December 2025, NewDay and I parted ways. The company have gone through some changes and as part of the restructure it was decided my role was no longer needed. There is a lot that I would have loved to have done, but I am proud of what I've achieved in my 3 years at the company. I got to work with fantastic people and I believe I was a good boy scout, leaving NewDay in a bit of a better state than it was when I arrived.

My last day was December 19th, which meant the two weeks that followed were filled with Holiday distractions. I had Christmas with my family followed by Chrimbo-Limbo and New Years with friends. I've spent this first full week of 2026 cleaning up after all the events in my house and letting everything finally hit me and settle in. 

This is the first time I've left a company not knowing what is next. It's quite surreal. What adds to the strangeness is that I can afford to take a bit of time to figure out what I want to do. I think I do need a little break before the next professional adventure, but also I don't need to rush anything, I can make sure that what is next is the right thing.

## What can we expect in 2026?

I am well aware that life happens in spite of the plans made, so I can't predict what will happen in 2026. Here is a list of some of the things I'd like to do early this year for myself:

- renew and do some more of my AWS Certifications once I've recouped the energy. 
- write more on this blog
- build a couple of talks to submit to conferences. (I know what I want to create, and I would like to find the time to do it well).

In terms of professionally, I want to keep leading. I'm hoping to find a great company that will take me on in a senior leadership position, ideally with more management than my previous role, but still working on technical strategy. What role that looks like, well it depends on whats in the realms of the possible. I'm always looking to push myself and so far, each time someone has thrown me out of my depth I have swam. 

## What do I offer?

I am experienced in cultural and technical change, having completed major projects across multiple companies. I've worked in all sizes of companies, at different states of maturity, mostly in highly regulated environments. 

If you are looking for someone who can plan and lead large scale changes, who is experienced in communicating at all levels, who is bizarrely organised, pragmatic and tries to build up those around her and make them as enthusiastic and bought into their work as she is - please, get in touch.

### The fine print

In my next role I would like to be as remote based as possible. With NewDay I went to the London office once a month and worked fully remote during flu season (end of Oct - March). I am immunocompromised and as such avoiding enclosed spaces, particularly in London, during flu season is essential for my health. I also find I'm more productive remotely and have demonstrated in a number of roles that I do not need to be in person to build relationships and culture. 

In my most recent position I found my time was not best spent coding (as much as that is painful to say). I keep technically current, and I am great at getting up to speed on domains and specifics quickly. I had to be good at that being responsible for the architecture of between 48 and 52 engineering teams at any one time. I have learnt that companies get better value out of me if I leave the coding to those who build every day and I work at a higher level. As such, I won't be considering roles that need me to code regularly for my next position.

### How am I doing?

I'm doing ok, thanks for asking. Change is always scary, especially when it's not one you've planned; but with change comes opportunity. I'm excited for what this year will bring; the new challenges, meeting new people and maybe even picking up some old habits and hobbies again. 

Meanwhile, if there is any topic of content you would like to see from me on this blog or in a talk format let me know! I've got a few ideas, but I would love to hear from you and what you would like me to talk about. 

Happy New Year everyone. I hope it's great for all of us. 

_Watch this space._
